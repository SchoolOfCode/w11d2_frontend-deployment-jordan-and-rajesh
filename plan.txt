-   Can mark items as complete
-   Can clear list in the front end, but this doesn't persist to the db


We want to:
-   Mark items as complete and have it persist upon refresh

    -   create a db column called markedForDeletion
    -   onClick of a list item will toggle completed between true and false
    -   false = not marked (plain text), true = marked (strikethrough)
    -   PATCH request on the frontend 
    -   write route in backend 
    -   write new function to overwrite completed status on each list item



-   Delete items from db when we hit the 'clear items' button

    -   Change text on button to say "clear completed items"
    -   onClick: DELETE all items from db with completed = true
    -   DELETE request on the frontend 
    -   write route in backend 

-   filter/ sort items in db
